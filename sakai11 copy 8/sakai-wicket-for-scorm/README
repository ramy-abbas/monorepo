Sakai Wicket README
-------------------------------------------------

Updated Aug 12, 2008


The goal of this project is to provide a base dependency for Wicket use within Sakai, and to collect together various
Wicket components and utility classes that will make it easy to build a standard Sakai tool. 

To get started, this project should be checked out into the sakai project directory the module "sakai-wicket" should be
added to the root pom.xml. This will allow maven 2 to find the sakai-wicket project and build it. 

We are now planning to add a built jar of this project to the Sakai maven repo, versioned independently of the Sakai Project 
versioning scheme. 

An example project that shows how to add "sakai-wicket" as a dependency and how to minimally integrate Wicket into Sakai
is available at sakai-wicket-template. This should also be checked out to the sakai root directory and added to the pom.xml
if you wish to build that example.
