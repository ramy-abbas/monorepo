README

This project is originally developed and maintained by UC Davis and made available on an ECL 1 license. 

UC Davis never got to finishing the project and never took the SCORM player to production.

At EDIA saw a growing demand for a workable SCORM player for Sakai. We've been fixing bugs and working
on the code base at several moments in time improving the stability. Furthermore, the option 
has been added to synchronized the results to the gradebook.

We at EDIA are dedicated to committing back our work and fixes. We've made our work available 
at the Sakai contrib repository.


Bugs and issues can be reported to:
